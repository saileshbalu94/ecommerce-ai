1. Overview
The Google Ads module will extend eContent AI to support the generation of ad copy for Google Ads campaigns. This will be implemented as a separate content generation pathway from the existing product description and title generator, while leveraging the same brand voice settings and overall UI framework. The module will include campaign management functionality, allowing users to save, reuse, and manage campaign settings.
