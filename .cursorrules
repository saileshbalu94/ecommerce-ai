  - Scale: $999/month (high usage)
- **Value-based pricing** significantly below the cost of hiring equivalent human resources
- **Usage-based components** for API calls beyond tier limits

## Future Roadmap (Phase 2+)
After validating the core product with the initial focus on product descriptions and titles, we outlined expansion to:
- Email marketing templates
- Social media posts
- Meta and Google ads copies
- SEO content
- Content calendar and scheduling
- Advanced integrations with eCommerce platforms
- Expansion to the Customer Support Agent use case as a complementary offering

This focused approach allows you to build and launch a valuable tool quickly as a solo founder, validate the market, and create a foundation for future expansion toward your "1-person unicorn" vision.
